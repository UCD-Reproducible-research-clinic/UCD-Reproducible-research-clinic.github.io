If you are just getting started, install the [R Programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) then download the integrated development environment (IDE) [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). 
When you open RStudio, type the following into your `command window` or `console`:

```{r setup, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```
